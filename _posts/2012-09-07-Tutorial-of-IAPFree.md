Please read the tutorial carefully for the new users of IAPFree.


## IAPFree Cydia Source / Repository

## How to install IAPFree
1. Add the Cydia Source  
2. Search "IAPFree" and install  
3. IAPFree icon apprears on your desktop if install successfully  

**Note:** Users could update smoothly from v2.x to v3.0 with Core plugin installed again. For users with v1.x, please remove it first and install the latest version.

## Usage of IAPFree v3.0.0  
### - Free for in-app purchase
IAPFree basically works on a *Core plugin*, which makes your in-app purchase FREE for most of Apps. So it is very important for you to install the Core plugin first. IAPFree also provides some special plugins for some games in which the Core plugin failed to work.

All plugins are listed in the “More” view by clicking the Plugins button at the bottom of IAPFree. They are labeled as *Installable*. After you install the Core plugin and some other plugins, they are labeled as *Installed*.

Now you can enjoy the IAP FREE by enable the IAPFree function.

**Note:** The most important KEY is that you should install the CORE plug-in after you have IAPFree installed. All other plugins could not work without the Core plugin.

### - Disguise Function
IAPFree provides functions of Fake UDID and Fake MAC address.  

It is easy to use the fake function. Your original UDID and MAC address are in blue. The generated fake UDID and MAC address are in red, which could be changed by random generation.

**Note:** You have to enable the function to make it work.
